# M5.4 canonical writeback — existing Production NoteMesh / Investment_OS

## Why this change exists

The October 25 Fresh Micro AWS/Jassy incident finished analysis but never wrote
the canonical notes. The deployed M5.3 planner accepts `sourceChat`,
`completedAnalysis` and `captureOnly`, yet one ChatGPT connector tool snapshot
exposed a stale schema without those fields. A read-only call with the complete
fields returned both M5.3 recipes, showing the backend planner itself works.
This is a **client metadata / orchestration incident**, not evidence that old
notes or the Production volume were lost.

## M5.4 scoped flow

On the *existing* Safe Edit OAuth endpoint (`vault:read vault:edit`):

1. `prepare_canonical_writeback` takes the exact original text, source/chat
   metadata, finished source-separated analysis (or `captureOnly:true`) and
   classification. It recomputes the M5.3 deterministic plan, validates
   add-only paths, and returns the **two exact Safe Edit diff previews and
   client-bound tokens** in one call. This performs no Vault note write.
2. After reviewing the diffs, `apply_canonical_writeback` takes the *same*
   input, `planId`, and exact pending preview authorizations. The existing
   Safe Edit engine pauses verified idle Sync, protects each path with CAS,
   journals a receipt/backup, writes source before review, and independently
   checks SHA/readback/index. The response re-plans from the actual Vault.
3. Only `outcome:saved_verified` / `readyForNextNews:true` confirms a finished
   Source + Canonical Review cycle. `source_saved_analysis_pending` is valid
   only for Feed Only. Inspect `interrupted` and individual `steps` when pending.

This is **recoverable add-only two-step writeback, not a single atomic file
transaction or background queue**. A successfully stored Source is retained
when a Review fails. Interrupted Safe Edit journal operations require operator
reconciliation; the system never silently overwrites another writer's note.

### Protective boundaries

- Uses the same Railway Production Service, `/data` volume, Vault and OAuth.
  No migration, additional Service, Admin or environment is required.
- No automatic mutation of `05_Thesis/` (Current Thesis, Evidence Register),
  `06_Portfolio/`, Company Evolution Timeline or historical source notes.
- Raw attachments require the separate binary archive receipt; text extracted
  from a PDF is not the original PDF.
- Remote Obsidian Sync and any mobile/desktop delivery are *unverified* by a
  server-side SHA/FTS receipt.
- Existing M5.3 planner + per-file Safe Edit remain available as fallback.
  Do not use legacy `submit_investment_notes` for canonical research.

## Connection metadata and acceptance

After the Production deployment is `SUCCESS`, **refresh/reconnect the existing
Safe Edit Chat connection in ChatGPT if its tool catalogue remains stale**.
Check that `prepare_canonical_writeback` and `apply_canonical_writeback` are
both discoverable, and that the prepare schema exposes `sourceChat` and
`completedAnalysis`. Backend deployment does not force a ChatGPT connector
snapshot to refresh.

In a new Micro chat, send one genuine source and analysis under the standing
Project instructions, without a separate Save command. Require (1) source,
(2) canonical review, (3) exact Safe Edit receipts, (4) SHA/readback/search
index, (5) no protected-file mutation, and (6) honest mobile Sync status.
Then repeat for Macro, PDF with real attachment bytes, Feed Only and multi-item
ordering. A regression test with synthetic content is not proof of automatic
behavior in a fresh ChatGPT conversation.
